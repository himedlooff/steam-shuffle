# Steam Shuffle #

I am suffering of the severe case of Steam Sale Syndrome and with 100+ games have problems deciding which one should I play. I am hoping to help myself and many others like to me to live the steam-sale-guiltless-life and enjoy playing games.


**[Symptoms] **

If you have 100+ games you paid for and still playing F2P Team Fortress 2 or other indie game you suffer from * Steam Sale Syndrome *.
From time to time you feel guilty about it and try play something totally different. 

**[Diagnosis]**

You suffer from Steam Sale Syndrome and you’re left with couple dozens of new games you haven’t even clicked on you need help! 

**[Treatment]**

Don’t waste an hour again trying to pick something you’d enjoy and leave that to the power of  s h u f f l e!
